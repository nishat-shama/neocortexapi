# Project Title : Implement Unit-Tests for the SpatialPooler AdaptSynapses method
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Introduction : 
AdaptSynapses in the SpatialPooler and SpatialPoolerMT class implements synaptic learning by strengthing
existing synapses between mini-columns and sensory input.

# Getting Started : 
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development 
and testing purposes. See the notes down on how to deploy the project and experiment on a live system.

**Project Description**
========================
AdaptSynapses in the SpatialPooler and SpatialPoolerMT class implements synaptic learning by strengthing
existing synapses between mini-columns and sensory input. Our task is to analyse how this method works 
and provide unit tests that each. Our task is to analyse how this method works and provide unit tests that 
achieve 100% code coverage of the method. An example of one unit test is testAdaptSynapses. CodeCoverage 
test is a feature in Visual Studio, which can be started as shown in the following image:

After the execution of the test, open the SpatialPooler.cs and SpatialPoolerMT.cs and look for the method 
AdaptSynapses.
